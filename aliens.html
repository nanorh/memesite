			<h1>Introduction</h1>	
			<p>
			Since before <i>E.T.</i> was a common household name there were theories that alien occupation on earth were unnegotiable. 
			For some hard core believers the evidence pointing towards a mass alien attack was true. The crop circles, 
			UFO's, abductions and rectal probes seemed all too real to just be passed off as a myth. With any luck this web 
			page will bring the believers out and the non believers into the light. Then onto a space ship. Then it will probe them.
			Below I have compiled five of the 'better' Alien theories and conspiracies including but not limited to:
				<ul id="list">
					<li>Roswell</li>
					<li>Area 51</li>
					<li>The Reptilians</li>
					<li>Ancient Astronauts</li>
				</ul>	
			
			Now I know what you're thinking, but bare fair warning, once you read this document it cannot be unread as you 
			will be lead deep into the world of alien activity. You will uncover all the mysteries of these theories and finally unveil the unknown.

			<h1>Roswell</h1>
			<img src="images/roswell.png" alt="Roswell" title="True or False?" width="300" height="200"/>
			<p>
			That's right, perhaps the most popular name in alien conspiracy theories to date. So let's start with arguably
			the grand-daddy of UFO conspiracy events: the supposed Roswell UFO incident. In 1947, the Roswell Air Force Base 
			issued a press release saying that they'd found a mysterious metallic disc on a nearby ranch. The press was, of course, 
			intrigued, but the base quickly changed their wording slightly: they'd found what appeared to be the remnants of a weather balloon.
			
			The change was not quick enough, of course: the local papers ran giant headlines saying that the air force had recovered a crashed 
			alien spaceship. And in the years since, that story has stuck, as accounts surfaced from employees at the base that include multiple
			crash sites, massive cover-ups, and even a reported alien autopsy (a film released in 1995 purported to depict the actual autopsy, but
			it its creator admitted that "most" of the footage was fake, thereby sort of discrediting all of the footage).
			Die-hards still stand by these scant accounts of fishy dealings at Roswell. The supposed cover-up has permeated public perception of the base,
			squadron of alien conspiracies. Some still believe that the spaceship remnants and alien bodies have been squirreled away in some sort of secret
			military enclave. But who's to say what is true and what is not? Some may call them crazy but one thing that the incidents in Roswell did teach 
			us is that alien activity is both powerful in the media and the minds of the believers.

			<h1>Reptilians</h1>
			<img id="obama" src="images/obama.jpg"  alt="Astronauts" width="400" height="300"/>
			<p>
			According to the “Disclosure Project  on the 9th May 2001 by 1989, 57 different varieties of alien beings had been catalogued. 

			The Disclosure Project is a nonprofit research project working to fully disclose the facts about UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and classified advanced energy and propulsion systems. We have over 500 government, military, and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct, personal, first hand experience with UFOs, ETs, ET technology, and the cover-up that keeps this information secret. 

			A former Army Sergeant who worked at NATO, Clifford Stone, has said the US Government had tried to suppress what he had actually seen one strange day in Pennsylvania, back in 1969. ”I was involved in situations where we actually did recoveries of crashed saucers. There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes. Also some of these were alive,” he said. “While we were doing this, we were telling the American public there was nothing to it. We were telling the world there was nothing to it,” Mr Stone added.  ”You have individuals that look very much like you and myself, that could walk among us and you wouldn’t even notice the difference,” he said.
			So, in conclusion, we are all reptiles from space. Who'd have thunk it.

		<section id="ancient">
			<h1>Ancient Astronauts</h1>
			<p>Yet again we come to another half baked theory made to scare, surprise and publicise. This time however it's personal. Ancient astronauts or ancient aliens, are purported intelligent extraterrestrial beings said to have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of human cultures, technologies, and religions. A common variant of the idea is that deities from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrials, and their advanced technologies were wrongly understood by primitive men as evidence of their divine status.
			These proposals have been popularized, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, by writers such as Erich von Däniken, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, David Icke, and Peter Kolosimo, but the idea that ancient astronauts actually existed is not taken seriously by most academics, and has received little or no credible attention in peer reviewed studies. Ancient astronauts have been widely used as a plot device in science fiction. But why take it from me? The following video shows conclusive proof that ancient astronauts exist!
