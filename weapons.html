			<h1>Surveillance</h1>
			<p>
				Particular technologies of surveillance and control arouse concern that has bordered upon, 
				or crossed over into, conspiracy theory. 
				These are technologies being developed by governments which are intended to intrude into the privacy or harm the persons of citizens, 
				particularly dissenters. Conspiracy theories of this sort cast government agencies as pursuing vast technical powers in order to spy on people, 
				control their minds, or otherwise suppress an alienated populace. 
				The plausibility of establishing such surveillance capabilities, by technical means or by a widespread network of informants, 
				should perhaps be viewed in the context of events in former Eastern bloc countries, 
				particularly the activities of the East German Stasi before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

			<h1>Espionage</h1>
			<p>
				Many governments use intelligence agencies to promote national policies in secretive waysâ€”in several cases including the use of sabotage, 
				propaganda, and assassination. 
				Intelligence agencies, such as the American CIA, the Soviet KGB, Great Britain's MI.6, the German BND and the Israelite Mossad, 
				are a common element of political conspiracy theories precisely because they are known to participate in some activities similar to those described in 
				conspiracy theories. 
				Indeed, conspiracy theories about espionage agencies go back at least as far as the 17th century, 
				with allegations the English spymaster Robert Cecil was responsible for the Gunpowder plot of 1605. 
				Some examples include the Pine Gap satellite tracking system in Australia, 
				which is believed by some to be a global database used to track individuals Big Brother style.

			<h1>Korean Airlines</h1>
			<p>
				Numerous theories have been put forward surrounding Korean Air Lines Flight 007, 
				a Boeing 747, carrying 269 people including anti-communist Cong.Larry McDonald. </br>
				KAL 007 was shot down near Moneron Island by the Soviet military after it strayed into prohibited airspace in 1983.
				These theories started in a Cold War era of heightened tensions and mutual distrust, 
				and have been fanned by subsequent misinformation, deception, suppression of evidence and political events.

					Peter Vogel's book The Last Wave from Port Chicago argues that the Port Chicago disaster was an accidental detonation or

					According to some theories the crashes of Arrow 1285 and TWA800 were caused by a secret electromagnetic directed-energy weapon.

					It has been reported that some in the Muslim world believe that the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was caused

					The Venezuelan state-run TV station ViVe has claimed that the 2010 Haiti earthquake was caused by US government testing an

			Intruder from the Future</br>
			First conceived in the 1950s, the B-70 Valkyrie was a nuclear-armed bomber designed to fly 15 miles high at three times the speed of sound. </br>
			Nicknamed the "Intruder from the Future," its fantastic, swept-wing shape was right out of a 50s sci-fi flick. </br>
			But due to design problems and 
			numerous cost overruns, by the time the first B-70 was built, it was already obsolete.</br>

			<h1>Churchhill on speed</h1>
			<p>
			Faced with a shortage of aircraft carriers to fight German U-boats in the Atlantic, 
			Winston Churchill championed this, one of the strangest ideas of WWII. 
			Plan Habakkuk was as silly as its name suggests: the job was to construct an enormous man-made iceberg, put dozens of warplanes on it, 
			then sail it into the Atlantic to do battle with Nazi subs.
			But the whole idea quickly sank for the most obvious reason: ice melts.
